        Hi, I'm Alejandro, a self-taught developer living in Santiago, Chile. I
        spend most of my time creating, learning, and sharing things that
        interest me. I'm especially drawn to simple, practical tools and the
        simplicity behind good ideas.

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
          I started programming by watching countless YouTube tutorials. My
          first computer couldnâ€™t run VSCode, so I used Atom to learn HTML and
          CSS basics. Soon, I shifted focus to JavaScript and Python, especially
          backend development with Node.js.

          My first computer was the one the government gave away.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸ’» My workspace</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
          I code primarily on my Windows laptop using WSL and Visual Studio Code
          loaded with extensions that boost productivity. I also rely heavily on
          AI tools to handle repetitive tasks, helping me write code faster and
          focus on solving complex problems.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">ðŸŽ¨ Outside the code</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
          Outside of coding, Iâ€™m committed to my education and doing well in
          school. Whenever I have free time, I dedicate myself to learning and
          practicing programming.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
          In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends and playing sports
          like table tennis, soccer, or whatever activity is available to stay
          active and have fun.
