    I'm constantly growing as a developer,
    <Highlight color="bg-sky-200">learning through documentation</Highlight>,
    videos, articles, and hands-on experimentation. I enjoy sharing my work,
    especially useful or interesting projects, which I regularly upload to my
    <a

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      class="underline text-gray-800 font-semibold">GitHub</a
    >. Being actively involved in the <Highlight color="bg-violet-200"
      >open source community</Highlight
    > is important to me, as it allows me to learn from others and contribute. I'm
    currently finishing high school and plan to study computer science or a related
    field to increase my skills. My long-term goal is to make a <Highlight
      color="bg-teal-200">living from programming</Highlight
    >, gain independence, and create relevant software that has a real impact.
